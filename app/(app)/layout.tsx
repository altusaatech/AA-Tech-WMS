  // super-admins included); zero bypass. The fill page lives outside this
  // (app) group so it stays reachable without an infinite redirect.
  //

  // If the DB hiccups (we've had transient pool/connection blips), we do NOT
  // gate this request rather than throw the layout for every page. The gate
  // re-applies on the next render once the DB is healthy — it's a workflow

  // already-registered (app) layout — is immune to that. The form refreshes on
  // submit, this layout re-checks, and the gate drops. Every authed page passes
  // through here, so direct URLs/deep links/back button are all gated. Applies
